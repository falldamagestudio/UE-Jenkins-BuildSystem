# Inbound Kubernetes agents will communicate with the controller via WebSocket rather than JNLP4.
# This removes the need for the agent to first connect to the regular HTTP(S) port, and then
#  connect to the agent-listener, non-HTTP(S) port; all traffic will go over the regular HTTP(S) port.
# This, in turn, makes routing and firewalling similar for agents outside the Kubernetes cluster -- and
#  and we'd like  to use the same connectivity model for Kubernetes agents to keep things as simple as possible.
