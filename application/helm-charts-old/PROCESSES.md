# Processes

This document outlines processes and procedures for some common tasks in the charts repository.

## Adding chart maintainers

Chart maintainers are defined within the chart itself.
So the procedure for adding maintainers is to add them there.
The pull request which does that should also update [CODEOWNERS](./github/CODEOWNERS) file to that the new maintainer is able to approve pull requests.
One of the existing chart maintainers needs to approve the PR in addition one of the repository admins needs to approve it.
They are then responsible for also granting the new maintainer write permissions to this repository.
